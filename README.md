# ISAT 252
We love academia.

This repo is structured to match the course, and it's content, see below:

- Week Directory (ex. week 1)
  - Notes.md - notes for the week, anything I feel may be on an assessment, or I just think is worth jotting down. 
  - assignment directory
    - tests.py - The tests used to ensure the assignment actually does what it needs to do
    - *.py - Any other python files are part of the assignment themselves
